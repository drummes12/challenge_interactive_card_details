## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScipt Vanilla
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - For styles

### What I learned

Reforce knowledge acquired in the basic and intermediate platzi courses, building coherent and scalable HTML, as well as trying to facilitate reading in styles and structure.

I learned the correct way to use the inputs of a form, and work with the states of this, in addition to the validation of the form by means of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### Continued development

From the forms I want to be able to collect and process the data from it in order to build a robust user registration application.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools Documentation](https://www.w3schools.com) - This page helps me to understand the functionality of the styles, and which ones I can use to interact with.
- [Stackoverflow](https://es.stackoverflow.com) - The doubts that arise usually find their answer on this page, with a great community, many times the answers are already there, you just have to know how to ask.
